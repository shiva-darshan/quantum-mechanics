    "        The deeper the well potential is, the more wavefunctions you will obtain. Mathematically, the explanation for this lies in the relationship between the values of the eigenenergies and the potential depth. This is a transcendental relationship and has to be solved numerically or graphically but one may note that by increasing the well depth, the values of the various energy eigenvalues become progressively more negative. Some important remarks are that, regardless of the well depth, there is always at least one bound solution in one dimension if the well depth is greater than zero, and that as the depth is made progressively larger, the energy levels shall approach those of the infinite square well.

    "        When the dimension of the confining potential becomes comparable to the de Broglie wavelength of the confined particle then we begin to observe so-called confinement effects. These manifest as a discretization of the bound state energy levels (when the de Broglie wavelength and well width are not comparable the particle behaves essentially like a free particle, with a continuous energy spectrum). As mentioned in task 1, the relationship between the energy levels and the width of the well is $E_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$; consequently, as we decrease the width of the well, the spacing of the energy levels becomes larger and larger. As an application of this effect we note that in a nanostructure the effect of increased confinement (reducing the size of the structure) is to increase the band gap of that structure. This can be leveraged to manipulate the opto-electronic properties of the nanostructure. \n",
    "        Furthermore, we note that in a classical potential, the lowest energy state would be at the bottom of the well. In quantum mechanics, the lowest energy state has a higher energy \n",
    "        than the bottom of the quantum well, as you can see in the figure below. \n",
    "        The reason for this energy difference is what is typically called the quantum \n",
    "        confinement effect. Observe also how the lowest energy state changes with \n",

    "       One can see that even although the potential outside the well is greater than the energy of the particle, there exists a non-zero probability of finding said particle at a position outside the well. This possibility of the particle \"tunnelling\" through the potential barrier in this way is a purely quantum mechanical effect. In the classical picture of this system one would never expect to observe the particle outside the confines of the potential well.\n",

    "### Controls\n",
    "There are three sliders you can tune interactively. Two of them adjust \n",
    "the width and depth of the potential well. The zoom factor slider is used \n",
    "to adjust the normalization factor of the wavefunctions. This factor is used for visualization \n",
    "purposes only, to avoid overlap of the wavefunctions whilst simultaneously preventing the wavefunctions from being so narrow that you cannot appreciate their shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive figure\n",
    "In the main visualization part, there are two subplots. The wide figure on \n",
    "the left shows the well potential and the square moduli of the eigenfunctions \n",
    "$|\\psi|^2$ of different states, plotted at the energy of the corresponding \n",
    "eigenvalues. The narrow figure on the right shows the eigenvalues.\n",
    "You can select either an eigenfunction or an eigenvalue by clicking on \n",
    "it in one of the two subplots. The eigenfunction and corresponding eigenvalue \n",
    "will be highlighted, and the corresponding eigenenergy and value of the index \n",
    "$n$ will be shown. All other eigenstates will fade out. By clicking the \"Show all\" \n",
    "button, you can reset the plot and show all states again."
